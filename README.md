# 📘 Intergrind by sortira

Welcome to **Intergrind** — a personal, portable repository of everything I need to revise on the go.

Whether it's an algorithm I cracked at midnight, a concept I struggled with for days, or a voice memo explaining something in *my* words — it’s all here, organized and accessible from anywhere.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

- 📱 Designed to **revise on the move** — optimized for mobile and GitHub Pages.
- 🧠 Builds **retention by repetition**, using **my own voice** and explanations.
- 🎯 Keeps everything **centralized**, lightweight, and accessible from any device.
- Most importantly for me, so don't send PRs or Issues.
